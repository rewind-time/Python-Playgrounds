##### How to install a module?

`pip install (module)`
of course remove the () and replace module with your module

```Python
""" first type the following"""
pip install module
"""
replace module with the module you want to install
after installing you can go in your python file and type the following: 
"""
import module
"""of course replace module here with the module you just downloaded"""
```

NOTE:
* i am using python version 3.8.6
* there is no copyright on any of these scripts
* have fun and keep coding!
